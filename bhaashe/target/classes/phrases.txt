I stood on the deck of Rajula=naanu Rajula da hajaarada mele nintukonde
she slowly moved out of Madras harbour=avalu nidhaanavaagi madras bandarina horage saridalu
I waved to my grandparents=naanu nanna ajja ajji ge kai beeside
I could see them no more=naanu avarannu matte nodalu aagalilla
I was thrilled to be on a ship=nanage hadagina mele iralu romanchana ayitu
It was a new experience for me=adu nanage hosa anubhava agittu
I spent the day exploring the ship=naanu idee dina hadagu anveshisutta kalede
It looked like a big house=adu dodda maneya haage kanditu
There was a swimming pool=alli ondu eeju kola ittu
there was plenty of room for everyone around=alli ellarigu saakaaguvashtu jaaga ittu
It looked just like a big house=
