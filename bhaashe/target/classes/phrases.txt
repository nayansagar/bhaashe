I stood on the deck of Rajula=
she slowly moved out of Madras harbour=
I waved to my grandparents=
I could see them no more=
I was thrilled to be on a ship=
It was a new experience for me=
I spent the day exploring the ship=
It looked just like a big house=
There was a swimming pool=
there was plenty of room to everyone around=
