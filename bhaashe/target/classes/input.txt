what are you doing
what will you do
What were you doing
you are coming with us
I stood on the deck of Rajula
she slowly moved out of Madras harbour
I waved to my grandparents
I could see them no more
I was thrilled to be on a ship
It was a new experience for me
I spent the day exploring the ship
It looked just like a big house
There was a swimming pool
there was plenty of room to everyone around
